# Ecosystem_Simulator

Tossing in my unity files for the ecosystem simulator. It's still a work in progress. The balancing needs work, and the predator pathfinding needs some tweaking too.  

Right now the deer population just explodes, then the cougars kill them all eventually. It's very difficult to balance this interaction, but what I need to do is balance deer and plants, then play with adding in the predators. Plants need to be redone, and drastically lowered.
